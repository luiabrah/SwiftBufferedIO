/// `FileScanner` provides a convenient interface for reading a file containing lines of text.
/// By default, `FileScanner` reads a line up to the new line delimiter (`\n`) but this can be changed using the `setDelimiter(_:)` method.
///
/// This class wraps a`BufferedReader`, providing improved memory performance when reading large files
/// compared to `FileHandle` which forces uses to read the entire file contents into memory.
///
/// `FileScanner` conforms to the `Sequence` protocol allowing files to be scanned through the use of a `for-in` loop.
/// ```
/// let fileHandle = ...
/// let fileScanner = FileScanner(fileHandle: fileHandle)
///
/// for line in fileScanner {
///    // Do something with `line`
///    process(line)
///}
